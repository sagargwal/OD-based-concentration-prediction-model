# Concentration Prediction Model Summary
This repository contains a linear regression model designed to predict concentration based on optical density (O.D) values. The model utilizes the gradient descent optimization algorithm to determine the optimal parameters (slope and intercept) for the linear regression equation.

# Key Components
1. Dataset Loading
The model expects a dataset with known pairs of O.D and concentration values. Users can replace the example dataset (x_train and y_train) with their own data.

2. Gradient Descent Optimization
The core of the model involves running gradient descent to iteratively update the model parameters (slope and intercept). The optimization aims to minimize the cost function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual concentrations.

3. Visualization
The code includes a visualization using Matplotlib to display the dataset's data points and the predicted linear regression line. This visualization provides an intuitive understanding of how well the model fits the data.

4. Prediction
Users can interactively predict concentrations for unknown O.D values using the trained model. The prediction is based on the optimized parameters obtained through gradient descent.

# Usage
Users can adapt the provided code to their specific datasets and requirements. The repository serves as a template for implementing a linear regression model for concentration prediction.

Feel free to explore, modify, and integrate this model into your own projects.
